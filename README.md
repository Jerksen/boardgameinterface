# boardgameinterface
End goal is an android app that allows users to track boardgame collections and plays while syncing them to BGG.

## background
The inspiration for this app is the BG Stats app on the play store. I have 2 main complaints that are big enough that I felt like I should take my own swing at making a play tracker
  1. Simultaneosly tracking plays for a basegame and expansions is difficult and requires duplication action. This should be easy, as BGG knows what an expansion is
  2. Having "Player Groups". BG Stats is great in that it always adds me as a player, but it would be great if I could create and name player groups that I could select when starting a new play (i.e. I often play 2 player with my wife, or 4 player with my wife and my parents - it would be great if I didn't have to search the list for them everytime I create a play)
  
## releases

### release 1

I've never made an android app before so this will start pretty basic and hopefully grow from there. I will start with manual adds of BGs and work my way towards BGG integration in this version in a push only capacity (i.e. not syncing plays down from BGG, only posting new plays).

### future

- Bidirectional interface with BGG (so you can basically use it as a cloud backup)
- Win/Lose/Points Stats
